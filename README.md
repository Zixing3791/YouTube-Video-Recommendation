# YouTube-Video-Recommendation

Background/Overview
YouTube is an online video-sharing platform owned by Google, used by multimillion-dollar corporations and individual content creators. Its content is accessible from various platforms such as computers, phones, gaming consoles, and smart TVs. It is one of the stickiest digital products with a stickiness factor of 0.13 with 315.12 million daily active users and 2.3 billion monthly active users and generated $19.7 billion in revenue in 2020.
Project Description
With its undoubtedly significant influence on today's pop culture, YouTube would like to commemorate some of the most impactful videos on its platform. The company is looking to create a series of playlists that capture the daily trending videos to achieve the goal through the past few months. Each playlist should consist of videos that are similar in nature to cater to users with various interests. This project will determine the number of playlists YouTube will need to create and generate relevant information for each playlist to help guide users to choose their playlist of interest. The motivation for this project stemmed from analyzing digital image products like apple photos, which create annual album collages for its users based on their photo library and ML algorithms. In the future, YouTube can also create personalized playlists based on each person's video history, and this project can serve as a pilot for individual playlist customization.
